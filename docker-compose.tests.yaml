    # In the starting commands we remove trust-ad from /etc/resolv.conf because the transitive dependency
    # trust-dns-resolver (v0.18.0-alpha.2) that handles dns queries for actix-http inside actix-connect
    # doesn't support that marker. Currently, this issue has been fixed in trust-dns-resolver (v0.20.0),
    # but no actix-http stable release uses it. Since this issue is happening only during the GitHub pipeline
    # we can remove trust-ad from /etc/resolv.conf inside this docker-compose. After a stable release of actix-http,
    # that has at least v0.20.0 of trust-dns-resolver is released, we can upgrade.
